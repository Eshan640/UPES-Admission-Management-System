## Brief description
This is a simple console-based Admission Management System written in C.  
It helps collect student details, check eligibility, run a short 10-question entrance quiz (school-wise), and save passing students into a file `students.txt`.  
I made this project to practice structs, arrays, functions and file handling in a practical, small system.

## Features
- Welcome screen + menu-driven interface  
- Input and validation (mobile, marks)  
- School & course selection (Business, Law, Computer Science)  
- 10-question quiz per school (original questions)  
- Pass threshold: 8 / 10  
- Save passed student records to `students.txt` (append)  
- View saved records from menu

##  What I Learned

While making this project, I practiced the following concepts:

- Working with **structures (struct)**  
- Using **arrays of structures**  
- Creating a **menu-driven program**  
- Validating user inputs  
- Implementing **functions** and code modularity  
- File handling (append, read)  
- Conditional logic (eligibility + quiz scoring)  
- Clean formatting & user-friendly output  

This helped me understand how to build a small console-based system from scratch.

##  Future Improvements

Some things I would like to add later:

. Better UI (colors using ANSI codes)
• Online registration portal
• Admin login system
• CSV/Excel export
• GUI-based interface
• Online quiz integration
• OTP verification
• PDF admission letter
